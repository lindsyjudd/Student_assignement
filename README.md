While working on the Statistics unit, you used Microsoft Excel's data analytics capabilities to analyze Southern Water Corp's Pump Data.  Now, Joanna Luez — Southern Water Corp's Lead Scientist — has requested that you convert your earlier analysis in Excel to Python Code. After all, with all the formulas in Excel, it can be tricky for others with less experience in Excel to follow.  Excel is an excellent tool for adhoc analysis, but Python is an invaluable tool thanks to its advanced data analysis capabilities that only take a few lines of code to complete.
Part II: Inferential Statistical Analysis
When you performed inferential statistics for Southern Water Corp using Excel, you made use of the data analysis package to create a heatmap using the correlation function. The heatmap showed the attributes that strongly correlated to Pump Failure.

Now, you'll create a heatmap using Seaborn's heatmap function — another testament to the fact that having Matplotlib and Seaborn in your toolbox will allow you to quickly create beautiful graphics that provide key insights
